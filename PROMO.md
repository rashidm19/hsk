**Title:** I open-sourced 12 complete HSK 4 mock exams (1,176 questions) — free JSON data for practice apps, Anki decks, or self-study

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I run a Chinese language school in Beijing (HSK Prep, since 2008), and I've been creating HSK mock exams for our students for years.

I decided to open-source all of our HSK 4 practice tests — **12 complete exams with 1,176 questions** covering:

- 听力 Listening (true/false + multiple choice, with audio file references)
- 阅读 Reading (fill-in-the-blank, sentence ordering, comprehension)
- 书写 Writing (multiple choice)

Everything is in clean JSON format, so you can:
- Build your own practice app
- Import into Anki or other flashcard tools
- Use it for NLP/language research
- Just study directly from the data

**Try it online:** [link to GitHub Pages demo]

**GitHub repo:** [link]

The data is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, so you're free to use and adapt it for non-commercial purposes.

If you find any errors or want to contribute, PRs are welcome! I'm also planning to add HSK 3 and HSK 5 tests later.

加油！🇨🇳

**Title:** Open-sourced 1,176 HSK 4 (Chinese proficiency) practice questions — free dataset for learners and app developers

**Body:**

I teach Chinese in Beijing and I've put together 12 complete HSK Level 4 mock exams over the years. Instead of keeping them behind our school's website, I decided to open-source everything.

**What's HSK 4?** It's the intermediate level of China's official Chinese proficiency test. Passing it means you can have conversations on a wide range of topics and understand ~1,200 vocabulary words.

**What's included:**
- 12 full practice tests (100 questions each)
- Listening, reading, and writing sections
- Answer keys for every question

## 4. DEV.to Article

**Title:** How I Open-Sourced 1,000+ Chinese Exam Questions from WordPress to GitHub

**Tags:** opensource, education, webdev, chinese

**Body:**

I run [HSK Prep](https://hsk4.mandarinzone.com), a Chinese language school in Beijing. Over the years, I built 12 complete HSK 4 mock exams using the AYS Quiz Maker WordPress plugin for our students to practice online.

Recently, I decided to open-source all of this content. Here's how I extracted 1,176 questions from a WordPress database and turned them into a clean, developer-friendly GitHub repository.

### The Challenge

Our quiz data was locked inside WordPress — stored across multiple database tables (`aysquiz_questions`, `aysquiz_answers`, `aysquiz_quizzes`) with HTML-embedded content, base64 images, and WordPress shortcodes for audio files.

### The Extraction

**Step 1: SQL Export**

I wrote targeted SQL queries to join the questions, answers, and quiz mapping tables:

```sql
SELECT 
    q.id AS question_id,
    q.question AS question_text,
    q.type AS question_type,
    a.answer AS answer_text,
    a.correct AS is_correct,
    a.ordering AS answer_order
FROM aysquiz_questions q
LEFT JOIN aysquiz_answers a ON a.question_id = q.id
ORDER BY q.id, a.ordering;
```

**Step 2: Data Cleaning**

The raw data had WordPress shortcodes like `[audio wav="..."][/audio]` and HTML entities everywhere. I wrote a Python script to:

- Extract audio URLs from shortcodes
- Strip HTML tags while preserving Chinese text
- Map question types based on content patterns
- Group answers by question ID

**Step 3: Structured JSON**

Each test became a clean JSON file:

```json
{
  "quiz_id": 2,
  "title": "HSK 4 Sample Quiz",
  "questions": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "type": "listening_true_false",
      "audio": "https://media.mandarinzone.com/.../hsk4-1-02.wav",
      "options": ["对", "错"],
      "correct_answer_index": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### The Result

- **12 complete HSK 4 mock exams** in JSON format
- **6 question types**: listening true/false, listening choice, fill-in-blank, sentence ordering, reading comprehension, and general choice
- **GitHub Pages demo** where anyone can take the tests online
- **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** license — free for non-commercial use

### What You Can Build With This

- A mobile HSK practice app
- Anki flashcard decks
- NLP training data for Chinese language models
- Your own quiz platform

Check out the repo: **[github.com/Make-dream-clear/hsk4-mock-exam](https://github.com/Make-dream-clear/hsk4-mock-exam)**

If you're learning Chinese or building language learning tools, I hope this helps. PRs welcome!
